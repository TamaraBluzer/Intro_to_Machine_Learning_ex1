# Comparison of Neural Network and Decision Tree Classifiers
## Machine Learning Exercise 1

### 1. Methodology

#### 1.1 Dataset
The Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset from scikit-learn was used for this comparison. The dataset contains features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast mass, describing characteristics of cell nuclei present in the images.

- **Data Split**: 80% training (455 samples) and 20% testing (114 samples)
- **Features**: 30 numerical features
- **Classes**: Binary classification (malignant vs. benign)

#### 1.2 Neural Network Implementation
The neural network was implemented with the following characteristics:

- **Architecture**: 
  - Input layer: 30 neurons (matching feature dimensions)
  - Hidden layer: 10 neurons with ReLU activation
  - Output layer: 1 neuron with sigmoid activation
  
- **Training Parameters**:
  - Learning rates tested: 0.01, 0.1, 0.5
  - Initialization methods: xavier, he, standard
  - Convergence criterion: loss change < 0.0001
  
- **Best Configuration**:
  - Learning rate: 0.1
  - Initialization: standard
  - Epochs until convergence: ~195-213

#### 1.3 Decision Tree Implementation
The decision tree was implemented using the ID3 algorithm with the following characteristics:

- **Split Criterion**: Information Gain using Entropy
- **Maximum Depth**: 5 (for better visualization and to prevent overfitting)
- **Feature Types**: All numerical, with binary splits
- **Stopping Criteria**: 
  - Maximum depth reached
  - Pure node (single class)
  - No further improvement possible

### 2. Results

#### 2.1 Performance Metrics

| Model          | Training Accuracy | Test Accuracy | Training Time |
|----------------|------------------|---------------|---------------|
| Neural Network | 99.12%          | ~95%*         | ~200 epochs   |
| Decision Tree  | 99.34%          | 93.86%        | Immediate     |

*Neural Network test accuracy varies slightly between runs due to random initialization

#### 2.2 Convergence Analysis

**Neural Network**:
- Different learning rates showed varying convergence speeds:
  - lr=0.5: Fast convergence (~110-120 epochs)
  - lr=0.1: Moderate convergence (~195-213 epochs)
  - lr=0.01: Slow convergence (~450-560 epochs)
- The model showed stable learning with minimal oscillations
- Final loss values indicated good fit without overfitting

**Decision Tree**:
- Single-pass algorithm with deterministic results
- No iterative training required
- Depth limit of 5 provided good balance between accuracy and complexity

### 3. Comparison Analysis

#### 3.1 Strengths

**Neural Network**:
1. High accuracy on both training and test sets
2. Good generalization capability
3. Flexible architecture that can be adapted to problem complexity
4. Smooth decision boundaries

**Decision Tree**:
1. Highly interpretable decisions
2. Fast training and prediction
3. No data preprocessing required
4. Handles both numerical and categorical features naturally
5. Clear feature importance through split decisions

#### 3.2 Weaknesses

**Neural Network**:
1. Requires hyperparameter tuning (learning rate, architecture)
2. Longer training time
3. "Black box" model - decisions not easily interpretable
4. Sensitive to initialization
5. Requires careful feature scaling

**Decision Tree**:
1. Slightly lower test accuracy
2. Tendency to overfit (shown by train-test accuracy gap)
3. Axis-parallel splits may not capture complex relationships
4. Performance sensitive to tree depth
5. Can be unstable - small data changes may result in very different trees

### 4. Conclusions

Both models achieved strong performance on the breast cancer classification task, with some key differences:

1. **Accuracy vs. Interpretability Trade-off**:
   - Neural Network achieved slightly higher test accuracy but lacks interpretability
   - Decision Tree provides clear decision rules but with slightly lower accuracy

2. **Training Efficiency**:
   - Decision Tree trains instantly
   - Neural Network requires iterative training but achieves better generalization

3. **Practical Considerations**:
   - Decision Tree better suited for situations requiring explanation of decisions
   - Neural Network better for maximizing predictive accuracy

4. **Implementation Complexity**:
   - Decision Tree implementation is simpler and more straightforward
   - Neural Network requires more complex implementation and tuning

### 5. Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend:

1. Use the **Decision Tree** when:
   - Interpretability is crucial
   - Fast training and prediction are required
   - The relationship between features is expected to be hierarchical

2. Use the **Neural Network** when:
   - Maximum accuracy is the primary goal
   - Training time is not a constraint
   - The relationship between features may be complex and non-linear

Both models demonstrate the classic machine learning trade-off between interpretability and performance, with each having clear use cases depending on specific requirements.
